                I am a small town named Kotdwara in Uttarakhand. Ever since I was a child I have a knack of solving puzzles. Even today in 		 my free time I tend to spend them on solving puzzles. My other interest is football and I have represented Uttarakhand 			 State football team at Junior level and still participate in various tournaments.
                When I was in 10th I had a coding syllabus in Java and that's from where I started having an interest in Computer Science 		field. Then I did my B.tech in Computer Science and Engineering from Graphic Era University.

                Now, I am pursuing M.tech in CS from IIIT, Hyderabad and I look forward to having a tough but fruitful learning experience.

                I also love to travel and thus being in Uttarakhand is a bliss, since it is tourist hub. The whole state is full of 			relegious shrines, forest reserves and the biggest highlight for me is The Himalayas Hills which give an ample choices to 			adventure sports enthusiat like River Rafting, Bungee Jumping, Rock Climbing and various Trekking Routes.
